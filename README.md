# Github Daily Helper

## To-do checklist

- [ ] Search team repositories in settings
- [ ] Add no PRs message for no PRs found and all PRs filtered out
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Show missing required `CheckRun`s, if possible
- [ ] Research and add tab with currently ran github actions for recently merged PRs (potentially filter by `CODEOWNERS`)
- [ ] Extract wording to translations file
- [ ] (Low priority) Rework `UserGroup`s empty states (reconsider what's shown on `DRAFT` PRs)
- [ ] List appropriate pull requests where a review from the team was requested
- [ ] Research how to make application start faster
